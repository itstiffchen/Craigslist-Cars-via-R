exploring Craigslist car posts

STA 141 Assignment 1 
broken up into Part 1 & Part 2

Part 1 
1. How many observations are there in the data set?
2. What are the names of the variables? and what is the class of each variable?
What is the average price of all the vehicles? the median price? and the deciles? Displays these on a plot of the distribution of vehicle prices.
What are the different categories of vehicles, i.e. the type variable/column? What is the proportion for each category ?
Display the relationship between fuel type and vehicle type. Does this depend on transmission type?
How many different cities are represented in the dataset?
Visually display how the number/proportion of "for sale by owner" and "for sale by dealer" varies across city?
What is the largest price for a vehicle in this data set? Examine this and fix the value. Now examine the new highest value for price.
What are the three most common makes of cars in each city for "sale by owner" and for "sale by dealer"? Are they similar or quite different?
Visually compare the distribution of the age of cars for different cities and for "sale by owner" and "sale by dealer". Provide an interpretation of the plots, i.e., what are the key conclusions and insights?
Plot the locations of the posts on a map? What do you notice?
Summarize the distribution of fuel type, drive, transmission, and vehicle type. Find a good way to display this information.
Plot odometer reading and age of car? Is there a relationship? Similarly, plot odometer reading and price? Interpret the result(s). Are odometer reading and age of car related?
Identify the "old" cars. What manufacturers made these? What is the price distribution for these?
I have omitted one important variable in this data set. What do you think it is? Can we derive this from the other variables? If so, sketch possible ideas as to how we would compute this variable.
Display how condition and odometer are related. Also how condition and price are related. And condition and age of the car. Provide a brief interpretation of what you find.

Part 2 (more broad) 
Find at least 3 types of anomalies in the data. Provide succinct justification for identifying them as anomalies. Then correct the corresponding observations appropriately, again providing justification. What impact does this have on analyzing the data?
Find at least 3 interesting insights/characteristics/features illustrated by the data. Explain in what way these insights are interesting (to whom? why?) and provide evidence for any inference/conclusions you draw. How generalizable are these insights to other vehicle sales data?
